     \brief The abstract interface of a GraphLab engine.
     The graphlab engine interface describes the core functionality
     provided by all graphlab engines.  The engine is templatized over
     the type of graph.
     
     The GraphLab engines are a core element of the GraphLab
     framework.  The engines are responsible for applying a the update
     tasks and sync operations to a graph and shared data using the
     scheduler to determine the update schedule. This class provides a
     generic interface to interact with engines written to execute on
     different platforms.
     
     While users are free to directly instantiate the engine of their
     choice we highly recommend the use of the \ref core data
     structure to manage the creation of engines. Alternatively, users
     can use the 
     \ref gl_new_engine "graphlab::engine_factory::new_engine"
     static functions to create
     engines directly from configuration strings.
